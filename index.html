						<h3>Q: What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular
							event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any). </h3>
						<p>A: My interest in IT started from high school when my brother first showed me the clock radio
							application that he developed to automatically broadcast the current weather. I was
							fascinated with the small app and amazed by how programming can benefit our lives. Then I
							become more interested in IT especially application development and try to understand how an
							application is developed from scratch. As we know there are a few fields related to IT this
							faulty, I would also like to explore my potential in different areas including cyber
							security and data science. The more I dive deep into the IT field, the greater achievement
							that I feel what provides by solving business problems via IT perspectives. </p>

						<h3>Q: Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
						<p>A: Firstly, RMIT is a global recognized top university with a good reputation which attracts
							me to undertake an international placement and gain a qualification for information systems.
							It embraces cultural diversity and respects individuals by providing more suitable and rich
							activities for international students. Secondly, it builds a flexible skillset with a
							combination of up-to-date, innovative and industry-relevant courses. Study at RMIT will take
							me to explore advanced technology and seek my potential in different fields. In the end,
							RMIT graduates are highly competitive in the job market and getting increasingly popular
							among recruiters. </p>

						<h3>Q: What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
						<p>A: I expect to dive deep into web/app development and cloud computing. To begin with, I know
							it’s important to understand the programming logic and network infrastructure, thus I would
							like to learn the most advanced programming language and framework. Apart from that, I also
							want to focus on and keep pace with the development of new technology, in this way to keep

								eligible for working as a business analyst. However, my analytical skills and
								communication ability needs to be reinforced since working in the industry is quite
								different from teamwork at university. Lack of experience in management and
								decision-making is also the critical knowledge that I should accumulate and develop in
								college. </p>

							<h3>Q: What is my plan for this position?</h3>
							<p>A: To enhance my analytical skills and management ability, I think I could develop them
								in my every teamwork assignment. By learning to communicate with different teammates I
								could learn how to deal with people with different characters on various projects. After
								all the essential of solution architect is in relation to communication with human and
								knowing their requirements. Apart from that, I would proactively participate the
								industry projects and try to seek more opportunities like interns or part-timer so that
								I can know how an IT company is processing in real, in this way I am able to gain more
								practical industry experiences. </p>

								which I didn’t notice before. When I am having teamwork with my teammates, I would
								possibly know what kind of role and job that I am eligible to work in within a team, in
								this case, I would finish the assignment in a harmonious and productive way without
								exposing my weakness that could harm to others. Also, when choosing teammates for a
								project, if I was the leader I would consider the diversified personality and traits
								based on the role differences. I think it will bring various perspectives and solution
								to one tough problem. </p>
