								since working in industry is
								quite different from teamwork at university. Lack of experience in management and
								decision-making is also the critical

							<h3>Q: What is my plan for this position?</h3>
							<p>A: To enhance my analytical skills and management ability, I think I could develop them
								in my every teamwork assignment. By
								learning to communicating with different teammates I could learn how to deal with people
								with different characters on
								various projects. After all the essential of solution architect is in relation to
								communication with human and knowing
								their requirements. Apart from that, I would proactively participant the industry
								projects and try to seek more
								opportunities like interns or part-timer so that I can know how an IT company is
								processing in real, in this way I am
								able to gain more practical industry experiences.</p>
